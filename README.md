To run the files, download the HTML Web Page V2 folder which includes all HTML, CSS 
and Javascript files. It can be run locally and should automatically connect to the 
firebase database 
(https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/capstone-fund-website/database/capstone-fund-website-default-rtdb/data).
If the browser gives errors due to the CORS policy, simply host the folder using Python local HTTP server
(instructions here : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server).
